# Deploying OpenMined to Xbox One

## Requirements

#### 1. Windows 10!
  - Mac users can install Windows 10: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204990 (Give boot camp at least 100GB)
  - Windows 10 Home works fine
  - Possibly there is a way to build for Xbox without Windows 10, but we haven't found it.
#### 2. Visual Studio 2017 (Installed on Windows 10)
  - Free community edition works fine: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
#### 3. Unity & Openmined! (Installed on Windows 10)
  - https://github.com/OpenMined/OpenMined#quick-setup
#### 4. Windows Store dev account
  - Costs $19 for an individual account: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/store/register
  - FAQ: https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-one/apps/developer-mode-activation-app-faq
#### 5. Xbox One Console... Preferably Xbox One X :)
